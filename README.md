# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Interpretable-ML
This project predicts heart disease using three explainable machine learning algorithms: RuleFit, Greedy Rule List, and Optimal Rule Tree (GOSDT), along with the CART (greedy tree classifier). The goal is to achieve both high prediction accuracy and enhanced model interpretability.
